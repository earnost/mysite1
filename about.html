            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Ben, a passionate videographer and photographer. I specialize in capturing moments that tell stories, evoke emotions, and create lasting memories. My journey in visual storytelling began seven years ago, and since then, I’ve had the privilege of working on various projects ranging from filming SEC Championships, shooting photography for live concerts, and filming campaign content for Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves.</p>
            <p>I believe in the power of visuals to communicate beyond words. My goal is to create content that resonates with people on a deeper level, whether through the lens of a camera or the intricacies of post-production. When I’m not behind the camera, you’ll find me playing pickleball or sipping a nice cappuccino.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or just say hello!</p>
